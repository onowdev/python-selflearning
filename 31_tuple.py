# A tuple is a collection of objects which ordered and immutable. 
# Tuples are sequences, just like lists. The main difference between 
# the tuples and the lists is that the tuples cannot be changed unlike lists. 
# Tuples use parentheses, whereas lists use square brackets.
# Creating a tuple is as simple as putting different comma-separated values
