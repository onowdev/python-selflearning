'''
The list is the most versatile datatype available in Python, 
which can be written as a list of comma-separated values (items) 
between square brackets. Important thing about a list is that the 
items in a list need not be of the same type.
Creating a list is as simple as putting different 
comma-separated values between square brackets.

list3 = ["a", "b", "c", "d",];
